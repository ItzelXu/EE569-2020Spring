Steps:

1. Open the .m file begin with 'Problem' in Problem 1 and Problem 2 folder to change the root of .raw file or .jpg file, add basicOperations folder into path.
	change the file name to decide which picture is wanted to be processed by comment and uncomment the code.
	These files are solutions to every sub-problem unber problem 1 and problem 2.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

The folder called basicOperator contains some basic matrix operator or some algorithm used in previous homework to help homework3 out.
	raw23D.m  raw22D.m  raw2img3.m
		These files are used to rearrange .raw to a image matrix
	matDotDiv.m  matMean.m  matMul.m  matSubMean.m  matStd.m  matTranspose.m
		These files are used to define operator between mats or mat and number, or operator on mat itself.
		The input is output of HisCount.m, and the CDF of pixels is returned.
	reflectionPad.m
		This file is used to padding image by odd mirror padding.

In Problem1 folder, there are following files to implement algorithm.
	draw_filter.m
		This file is used to draw the frequency response of Laws filter
	energy_25_15.m  energy_15_14.m energyRow_25_15.m
		These files are used to convert the 25-dimension features into 15-dimension features, or convert the 15-dimension features into 14-dimension features.
		The input is the corresponding feature vector obtained by getFeatureMap.m
	featureAverage_abs.m, featureAverage_abs_win.m, featureAverage_abs_win_Gaussian.m, featureAverage_sqr.m
		These files are used to get the average energy for each feature map, either get the energy map of each pixel or get the energy vector for the single image.
		There are several ways are used to get the average energy, one is to average absolute value the whole feature map, the other is to average the square value of the whole feature map
		In featureAverage_abs.m and featureAverage_sqr.m, the input parameter is the feature map obtained by getFeatureMap.m
		In featureAverage_abs_win.m, 1st input parameter is the feature map obtained by getFeatureMap.m, 2nd parameter is the radius of the window.
		In featureAverage_abs_win_Gaussian.m, 1st input parameter is the feature map obtained by getFeatureMap.m, 2nd parameter is the radius of the window, 3rd parameter is the sigma of Gaussian kernel.	
	filtImg.m
		This file is used to calculate the convolution between selected kernel and image.
		1st input parameter is the image to be processed, 2nd parameter is the selected kernel.
	getFeatureMap.m
		This file is used generate the 25-dimension feature map for each pixel.
		The input parameter is the image to be processed.
	holeFilling.m
		This file is used to perform the final step of advanced texture segmentation.
		The input parameter is the image generated by labeling.
	k_means.m
		This file is used to perform Kmeans algorithm.
		1st input parameter is the data matrix to be classified, 2nd parameter is the number of classes to be clustered.
	lb_mp2img.m
		This file is used to convert the labeled image to discrete pixels evenly distributed between 0 and 255.
		1st parameter is the label matrix to be converted, 2nd parameter is the number of unique label.
	PCA_dim.m
		This file is used to do feature dimensional reduction by PCA
		1st parameter is the data matrix, 2nd parameter is the number of dimensions of the feature to be preserved.
